## Introduction

This Jupyter notebook showcases various text preprocessing steps using NLTK to prepare textual data for AI or machine learning models. The project involves importing necessary libraries, reading a CSV file, and performing multiple data cleaning operations.

## Data Processing Steps

1. **Import Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, and NLTK.
2. **Read CSV File**: Load the dataset using Pandas.
3. **Convert to Lower Case**: Ensure uniformity by converting all text to lower case.
4. **Remove Punctuations**: Clean the text by removing punctuation marks.
5. **Remove Stop Words**: Eliminate common stop words to reduce noise.
6. **Remove Frequent Words**: Remove the most frequent words to focus on significant terms.
7. **Remove Rare Words**: Remove words that appear infrequently.
8. **Remove Special Characters**: Use regular expressions to clean special characters.
9. **Stemming**: Create a new column with stemmed text.
10. **Lemmatization**: Create another new column with lemmatized text.
11. **Remove URLs**: Use regular expressions to eliminate URLs.
12. **Remove HTML Tags**: Clean the text by removing HTML tags.
13. **Spell Checker**: Correct spelling mistakes in the text.
14. **Remove Words Starting with 'http'**: Further cleaning of URLs and related text.
